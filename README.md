# PriorityMatrix
A Rainmeter skin to organize your to-do list according to a 2x2 priority matrix. More info on this method [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method).

# Setup (Windows only):
1. [Download and install Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net) (see below for cloud syncing across devices).
2. Copy the PriorityMatrix folder from this repository to the Skins folder where you installed Rainmeter.
3. Open Rainmeter (find Rainmeter.exe or Rainmeter icon in taskbar).
4. Click Refresh All.
5. PriorityMatrix should now be listed on the left. Expand it, click PriorityMatrix.ini then Load.

# Adding tasks:
Clicking on Do now, Delegate, Schedule, or Eliminate opens a text file to enter your tasks. Edit as desired and save it (you can use any UTF-16 characters such as check marks or empty boxes). It should update the relevant quadrant automatically. 

# Always on Desktop
To keep PriorityMatrix stuck to the Desktop, right click on it (after it's been loaded): Settings -> Poisition -> On Desktop
This prevents interference with other apps' UIs.

# Cloud syncing:
You can sync tasks across devices by installing the portable version of Rainmeter on a cloud folder (eg Onedrive). To launch Rainmeter on startup in this case follow [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/208224/how-to-add-programs-files-and-folders-to-system-startup-in-windows-8.1).
